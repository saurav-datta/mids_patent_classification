## Goal 
Patent automatic classification (PAC) tasks have drawn a lot of research interest in the recent years as the worldwide patent application submissions keep increasing. Most of the currently used approaches for automatic patent classifications are dependent on the knowledge of domain experts. In this project we propose a hybrid neural network model for multi-label multi-class patent classification, which will be able to capture important features and long term dependencies. We will compare the results of the proposed model and two baseline models, namely an Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Long-Short-Term memory (LSTM) network. We hope that our proposed model will outperform other models applied by researchers for the patent classification task referred to [here](https://res.mdpi.com/def50200a1fc8ccc5cf792a61634f71ed736075024de9cd3f53580e3974e7b8c3869cb1ac14f9a35186e8ca354cef0359e40a64c1b5cfd44ad213c90b4d10caf72f83dc342ac2fc5e121269a960c76c9b2ce4de292c52065365db446022b1a2d4a0d2bca8b4563d79c8001ce69ed62227189389f263037a2bf4db07d1674742378a28b0fd65cbbf67cc5496a130493e396416ed0b2716aded5eed5e8b6f089c6bed2fe3797?filename=&attachment=1) . 



## Terminology

International Patent Classification [IPC](http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/ipcpub/?notion=scheme&version=20180101&symbol=none&menulang=en&lang=en&viewmode=f&fipcpc=no&showdeleted=yes&indexes=no&headings=yes&notes=yes&direction=o2n&initial=A&cwid=none&tree=no&searchmode=smart) 


Patent Automatic Classification (PAC): A PAC system is designed for classifying patents into corresponding categories.

## BiLSTM analysis
The BiLSTM analysis is on a separate branch:
